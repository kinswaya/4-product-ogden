  <h2>NAHS to Create Sculpture in Foyer</h2>
        <p style="w3-small">By Kinsey Ogden</p>
        <p>A kaleidoscope of color dangling in the foyer: three giants converse in the air, strung from the ceiling, chatting of joy and diversity. Up close, the giants aren’t really giants at all; they are groups of perfectly placed pendants of individuality and symbols of unique traits. The foyer will soon house this image thanks to the National Art Honor Society (NAHS).</p>
        <p>The honor society has been working on a sculpture to be hung in the foyer since last school year. Mrs. Daviso, the art teacher who advises NAHS, said, “We have the larger idea firmed up, and so it feels like we’re at a place where we can really start to actually make the individual parts and kind of take it to the next step.”</p>
        <p>Last school year, the team originally planned to craft the sculpture’s components out of plexiglass, but after complications with the amount of funds and necessary tools, the idea’s materials were adjusted.</p>
        <p>Making the sculpture will now include a process of shaping clay pieces, forming silicon molds out of the clay, and then finally casting resin pieces with the molds. Using the resin material also opens up options for a medley of color schemes and appearances.</p>
        <p>NAHS students are not the only ones that will be able to lend a hand to this project. Students not involved in the project will have the opportunity to create their own unique clay figure that represents who they are. Daviso said the hope is that H-Block teachers will “let some of the NAHS students...come in and lead their H-Blocks through making some of these pieces so that every single student in the building ends up making at least one.”</p>
        <p>According to senior Makena Maszer, president of the NAHS, “We want the final product to truly represent the school community, so we’ve been sculpting pieces that speak to different aspects of what people here are involved with.”</p>
        <p>The NAHS is currently deciding between having a blue and gold color scheme, to represent AHS’s school colors, or creating a rainbow in the foyer. If the team decides to hang an artificial band of color, students participating would likely be able to chose not only their piece’s shape, but its tint as well. Students and faculty will be able to either view blue and yellow splashes of color throughout the sky or streams of the rainbow dancing against the ceiling.</p>
        <p>When the sculpture will be displayed in the air and how quickly it will be set up has not been confirmed. Senior Makena Maszer, president of the NAHS, said, “It will ideally be hung up all at once, but I can’t say for sure. Part of it depends on what the town actually permits [the NAHS] to hang up in the foyer” based on the weight limitations of the ceiling.</p> 
        <p>Originally, the artists were going to create the image of a face looking down at the passing students and faculty, but the NAHS then decided that one face may seem to glare at them instead and form a suffocating atmosphere. Daviso said that the team “thought that if maybe there were three [faces], it would start to feel like there was a conversation going on and that it would feel sort of personal and friendly.”</p>
        <p>The NAHS students won’t be tackling the project alone though, since visiting sculptor Stu Schechter will continue to help them along the way. Schechter has completed similar projects before and offered a hand in case the team had trouble creating the piece. Daviso says that Schechter is currently acting as “someone to offer some guidance and structure to the project” through email with Daviso.</p>
        <p>Although the artists only began working on the project in mid-October this year, Maszer said that “the end result is going to be amazing. NAHS is full of very talented and passionate artists, and the sculpture we end up with will absolutely reflect that.”</p>

  <h2>Drama Guild Debuts ‘Sweeney Todd’ Nov. 16</h2>
    <p>By Kinsey Ogden</p>
    <p>On November 16th, the AHS Drama Guild will debut this year’s fall musical, Sweeney Todd: School Edition, in the Collins Center.</p>
    <p>Students will be able to view the performance for only $5 (with a student ID) at any of their performances on Nov. 16, 17, 18, and 21 at 7:30pm. There will also be a matinee at 2:00pm on Nov. 19. Adults will be admitted for $20, while students without IDs and seniors will be admitted for $15, except on opening night, where all students and seniors will be admitted for $5.</p>
    <p>This year, it will be more difficult than in previous years to schedule a school preview because the range of possible times for the showing is limited. Due to no school on Nov. 9 and 10 because of a teacher workshop day and Veteran’s Day Observance, there is not much time between the possible occasions for the preview and opening night. If the preview does occur, it will likely take place during an H-Block so no time is taken from class.</p>
    <p>According to Ms. Choquette, the musical’s director, the musical focuses on Sweeney Todd, a barber formerly named Benjamin Barker. After 15 years of being imprisoned by a biased judge, Sweeney returns to his hometown, London, only to find his wife dead and his child adopted by the same judge that imprisoned him. He then befriends Mrs. Lovett, a meat pie shop owner, who becomes his partner in crime. Choquette said that Sweeney Todd then shows “how he is seeking to get revenge on the people that turned his life upside-down.”</p>
    <p>Sweeney Todd, who the show is named after, will be played by sophomore James Call, while Mrs. Lovett will be played by senior Katherine Wolfendale. The judge will be portrayed by senior Jake Dalimonte, while his assistant, the Beetle, will be played by senior Chris Marchese. The role of the judge’s adopted daughter will be filled by junior Katie Nam, while her lover, Anthony Hope, will be filled by sophomore Spencer Daniel.</p>
    <p>The show will be a more challenging one despite a simplified version being used. Choquette explained that “this is a really challenging show. It’s a school edition, so it's been simplified slightly, but even though it’s been simplified, it is still a challenge. Our cast is not only talented, but they’re hard working and the hardworking part is even more important in a show like this.”</p>
