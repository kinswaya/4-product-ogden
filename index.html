                        <h2>New Wooden Benches on Third Floor</h2>
                        <p>It’s 7:30 am and while the crowds create chaos in the foyer and cafeteria, a gentle hum of chatter is the ambient soundtrack to the upstairs hallways. Kids are scattered, sitting down on the floor everywhere - up against lockers, outside of classrooms, and even under the stairs. Although two crevices on the third floor used to house similar situations, the lockers have been stripped from the walls and in their places are wooden benches that run along the walls.</p>
                        <p>The benches may not seem like much at first glance, but they hold more than one would expect. As a reflective, white Wi-Fi router mounted on the ceiling transmits a wireless signal, two lights illuminate the area to be even brighter than the rest of the hallway and two overhead vents regulate the room temperature. On the two small, inner walls, two outlets allow students to recharge their devices without moving too far.</p>
                        <p>One sophomore, Diana Kreismonis, said, “They're a great place for big groups to convene without causing traffic or getting in the way of other students,” since the benches seat the students that used to crowd the floors.</p>
                        <p>Just five months ago, this idea didn’t even exist yet. It didn’t exist until late October, when Principal Conrad and the Facility Study Committee at AHS noticed that around the school, “A lot of times, you’ll see that there are kids collaborating, but they’re sitting on the floor,” according to Principal Conrad.</p>
                        <p>From there, the idea started to formulate. Superintendent Berman stated that one day, he “noticed the locker alcove on the third floor and thought it would make a good experiment to see how that kind of space would be used by students.” After the idea was approved by Janet Nicolia, Director of Facilities in Andover, it started to morph from just a possibility to a reality.</p>
                        <p>Several Andover-based companies were involved: Landmark Finishes of Andover made the benches while Eaglepoint Builders created the area around the benches, then You Good Construction installed them. The arduous process of installing the benches not only involved removing the lockers, but it also involved jackhammering out the concrete bases that the lockers previously rested on, crafting the benches offsite, and working in the school only during weekends and vacations weeks.</p>
                        <p>In the end, the process created the comfortable location, which is evidently well-equipped to seat high schoolers. The benches may create a new spot to sit in the morning that isn’t a floor coated with dirt, but they’re not just for before and after school.</p>
                        <p>According to Dr. Berman, the school superintendent, the committee “wanted to provide students with a more relaxed environment in the school in general but also provide some breakout spaces for students to work together when they were doing group work in classrooms.”</p>
                        <p>Conrad said that the committee’s aim was to “create some collaborative spaces that were much more appropriate for our students,” so that when students are working in the hallways for classes, they’ll have a place to work all together.</p>
                        <p>While the areas may seem like a final product, the Andover High School Facility Study Committee is still working with Eagle Point Woodworkers to allow students even more options when collaborating there. Mrs. Nicosia, the Director of Facilities, revealed that “The tables are being manufactured now and should be finished within about 3 weeks.”</p>
                        <p>The tables may be the last puzzle piece for those specific areas, but the committee isn’t finished with their work. The group will continue to work on building and installing more collaborative spaces for students to spend time.</p>
                        <p>According to Conrad, “They’re part of a larger idea to try and make more collaborative spaces, and the ideas really came out of beginning to look at how to renovate the building in ways that could be done immediately.” </p>
